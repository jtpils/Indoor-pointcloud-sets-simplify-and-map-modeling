# Indoor-pointcloud-sets-simplify-and-map-modeling
Based on C++,and may use GPU coding in the future


This project is mainly use Visual Studio 2015,and check the output by using Meshlab

I'm still working on it.After collecting a indoor pointcloud set with Kinect or other sensors,I mainly simplify the set,
cause there are too much unuseful data.After this,we just need to calculate how many big planes in the set and their equations.I keep hundreds of points for each plane.
